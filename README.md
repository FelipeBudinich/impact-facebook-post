impact-facebook-post
====================

Post a Screenshot of your game to facebook

This is a very simple and dirty example of posting a screen capture of your canvas game and posting it to Facebook.

This set up also doesn't start the game until the user has logged in to Facebook.

This isn't really set up to be a plugin but more of an example of how to take a screen shot from a game and post it to FB.  This will work completely out of the box, you just need to add your copy of Impact to the folder and then make a FB app id and add it to the bottom of the impact-facebook-post.js file where it is looking for a FB app Id
